### programming skills

To get an impression of the skill level we expect in Python, you can try out the Python crash course on binder here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/seismology-hamburg/master/main). Wait for the binder server to load and click on `notebooks > E00_python_crash_course.ipynb` to launch the notebook. You can then directly work inside the jupyter notebook.
